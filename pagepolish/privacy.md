# Privacy Policy for PagePolish

**Last Updated: January 20, 2026**

## 1. App Identification
This privacy policy applies to the **PagePolish** app for Confluence Cloud, developed and maintained by **Red Kernel**.

## 2. Data Access and Collection
PagePolish is designed to process Content within Confluence only when explicitly triggered by you.

*   **Confluence Content**: When you use PagePolish to scan or clean a page, the app reads the content of that specific Confluence page to identify and fix formatting issues.
*   **User Action**: Data access occurs **only** when a user manually initiates a "Scan" or "Clean" action. The app does not run in the background or access data without user interaction.

## 3. Data Processing
*   **Infrastructure**: PagePolish is built on the **Atlassian Forge** platform. All data processing occurs within Atlassian's secure infrastructure.
*   **No External Processing**: We do not transmit page content to any external servers or third-party APIs outside of the Atlassian Forge environment.

## 4. Data Storage
*   **Zero Persistence**: PagePolish does not store, cache, or archive any of your page content. Once the formatting logic is applied, the data is discarded from the app's memory.
*   **Settings**: Simple user preferences (such as checkbox states for "Remove empty lines") may be stored using the Atlassian Forge Storage API to provide a consistent user experience. This data contains no personally identifiable information (PII) or page content.

## 5. Data Sharing
We do not share, sell, or disclose your data to any third parties.

## 6. Analytics and Logs
We may collect anonymous technical logs via the Atlassian Forge platform to monitor application health and debug errors. These logs do not contain page content or user PII.

## 7. Contact Information
