# Service Level Agreement (SLA)

**Effective Date:** January 24, 2026  
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Scope of Service
This Service Level Agreement ("SLA") covers the use of software applications ("Apps") provided by **RedKernel** on the Atlassian Marketplace. It describes the levels of support and service availability you can expect from us.

**Included:**
*   Technical support for configuring and using our Apps.
*   Assistance with troubleshooting errors or unexpected behavior directly related to our Apps.
*   Updates and patches to fix bugs or security vulnerabilities.

**Excluded:**
*   Support for Atlassian products themselves (Confluence, Jira, etc.).
*   Issues caused by Atlassian platform outages or third-party apps.
*   Custom development or consulting services.
*   Support for legacy versions that have reached their End of Life (EOL).

## 2. Support Availability
Our support team operates during standard business hours.

*   **Support Channels:** Email via [support@redkernel.de](mailto:support@redkernel.de) or our [Support Page]({{ "/support.html" | relative_url }}).
*   **Business Hours:** Monday – Friday, 09:00 – 17:00 CET (Central European Time).
*   **Holidays:** We observe public holidays in Germany. Support is closed on these days.

## 3. Incident Severity & Response Times
We prioritize tickets based on the severity of the issue. While we strive to respond as quickly as possible, our target response times are defined below.

| Severity Level | Definition | Target Initial Response |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Severity 1 (Critical)** | **App is down or unusable.** Critical functionality is broken for all users, with no workaround available. | within 8 Business Hours |
| **Severity 2 (Major)** | **Feature broken.** A key feature is not working or performance is significantly degraded, but the App is still usable. | within 24 Business Hours |
| **Severity 3 (Minor)** | **Minor issue / Question.** Cosmetic inquiries, general questions, or feature requests. | within 72 Business Hours |

*Response times are calculated during Business Hours.*

**Example:** A request received on Friday at 16:00 CET may receive a response by Monday morning.

## 4. Resolution & Updates
RedKernel provides support on a **commercially reasonable basis**. We cannot guarantee a fixed fix time for every issue, as complexity varies.

*   **Incident Updates:** For ongoing issues, we will provide status updates via email as reasonable progress is made.
*   **Updates:** Critical security fixes are prioritized over feature development.

## 5. Maintenance & Downtime
We rely on the Atlassian Cloud platform. If the Atlassian platform is down, our Apps may also be unavailable.

*   **Planned Maintenance:** We strive to schedule maintenance outside of peak business hours.
*   **Platform Status:** Check [status.atlassian.com](https://status.atlassian.com/) for platform-wide issues.

## 6. Customer Responsibilities
To help us resolve your issue quickly, please:
*   Provide a clear description of the problem.
*   Include steps to reproduce the issue.
*   Provide screenshots or log extracts (please redact sensitive information).
*   Grant temporary access or provide a screen share if necessary for debugging.

**Data Privacy:** Please do **not** send us sensitive personal data (PII) or confidential business data in support tickets.
